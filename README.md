# NotaryGenie
Final Year Project

# 1. Problem Statement / Motivation
Notaries are responsible for preparing notarial deeds for immovable property transactions. They have to collect and verify relevant documents and write the notary deed. This process can be quite tedious and time consuming as it involves several parties namely the notary, the buyer, the seller(s) and in some cases the bank, the Registrar-General office, the Ministry of Housing and Land Use Planning or even the Mauritius Revenue Authority. Such a notarial deed requires accurate information. Thus far, this process is being done manually and so errors can occur. Therefore, there is a need to develop an application that can streamline the workflow and processes in the preparation of a notarial deed.

# 2. Aim and Objectives
The aim of this project is to develop a web application with AI features that will provide the staff of a notary office with a platform that can be accessed from various devices including but not limited to desktop computers, tablets and mobile phones regardless of their operating system to ease the processes involved in drafting notarial deeds.
The main objectives of this project are to : 
Extract key information such as names, date of birth and address from source documents like birth certificate, national ID card, proof of address and then store this information for systematic retrieval for the preparation of notary deeds.
Store necessary confidential documents (scanned using phones/tablets) of clients for fast and easy retrieval.
Implement an AI assistant regarding local laws and regulations concerning notaries.
Prepare automatically a draft of the deed based on the type of contract and a corresponding template as a Microsoft Word document.
